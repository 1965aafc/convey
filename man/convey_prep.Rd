\title{prepare svydesign and svyrep.design objects for the convey package}
\usage{
convey_prep(design)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{a survey design object of the library survey}
}
\value{
design a survey design object of the library survey
}
\description{
stores the full survey design (needed for convey functions) within the design
}
\examples{
library(survey)
library(vardpoor)

# linearized design: convey_prep must be run as soon as the linearized design has been created

# since convey_prep() was run immediately after creating the design
# this will calculate the correct variance
